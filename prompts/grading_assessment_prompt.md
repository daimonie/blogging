**Prompt: Evaluating a Political or Policy Writing Draft**

Assess the article or draft as if it were written for a graduate-level course in *Writing for Politics and Policy*. Your evaluation should emphasize the clarity, rigor, and persuasive precision expected in high-level policy communication.

When grading, focus on the following:

1. **Argumentation and Thesis**
   - Does the piece present a clear, focused, and debatable thesis?
   - Are the arguments logically structured and free of tangents or repetition?
   - Does the author demonstrate critical thinking and awareness of counterarguments?

2. **Use of Evidence**
   - Are claims supported with credible, relevant, and specific evidence (e.g., data, reports, legislation, scholarly sources)?
   - Does the author integrate evidence smoothly rather than listing facts?
   - Are numbers or statistics interpreted correctly and used to advance the argument?

3. **Structure and Transitions**
   - Is the piece organized with a logical flow from introduction to conclusion?
   - Do paragraphs transition cleanly, with each one building on the last?
   - Are topic sentences and transitions precise and purposeful?

4. **Clarity and Style**
   - Is the prose crisp, professional, and free of filler or jargon?
   - Does the writing balance sophistication with accessibility for a policy audience?
   - Are sentences varied in structure yet controlled and coherent?

5. **Tone and Audience Awareness**
   - Is the tone appropriate for a policy or political context (analytical, measured, and persuasive without partisanship)?
   - Does the writer show understanding of stakeholders, context, and implications?

6. **Mechanics and Presentation**
   - Is the draft free from grammatical and typographical errors?
   - Are citations formatted correctly and consistently?
   - Is the overall presentation polished and publication-ready?

Assign a grade (A–F) based on how well the draft meets these criteria, and provide a brief paragraph summarizing strengths and areas for improvement.

In the case of typos, metaphors that are wrong or similar, provide a case-by-case bullet point list for easy fixing.
