# The Hidden Infrastructure of Modern Life

## How the cloud underpins everything
Do you use the cloud? Probably you do - even if you don't realize it.

For those of us not working in IT, *the cloud* is almost mythical. The cloud is the solution for everything and nothing. It's important to realize that *the cloud is the foundational layer* of modern society. Not only public services, government institutions, banks and public transport rely on cloud platforms, but also commodities: Your phone, laptop, website, apps, smart home devices - all constantly interacting with the cloud.

In essence, the cloud means renting someone else’s data center. Instead of each organization maintaining its own servers, companies now rent computing power from global platforms. Over time, this evolved further: you can now rent not just raw computing resources, but also the *software* and *infrastructure* that run on them.

This dependence has recently intensified with the rise of *Generative AI* — systems like ChatGPT, Grok, and Mistral all require enormous data centers to function. And it’s not just people using these tools anymore: much of the software we depend on is now quietly powered by generative AI as well. Automation, personalization, and even decision-making are increasingly driven by AI models that live — and learn — in the cloud.

I can't repeat this enough: Modern life relies on the cloud.

## Why Dependence on Foreign Platforms Matters

And we don’t control that cloud. Almost all of the infrastructure we rely on — including systems used by our government, semi-public institutions, and major corporations — runs on **American hyperscalers.** These companies are vast, benefit from enormous economies of scale, and integrate open-source innovations into cohesive, high-performance platforms.

They are, in many ways, marvels of engineering — but they are not *ours.* They answer to shareholders, not to citizens. Their priorities are commercial, not public. When critical digital infrastructure depends entirely on foreign entities, we lose not just technical control, but also democratic oversight.

This dependence carries legal and political risks as well. The **U.S. CLOUD Act** (Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act) gives American authorities the right to demand access to data held by U.S.-based companies, even when that data is stored abroad. In practice, this means that information hosted on American cloud platforms may fall under U.S. jurisdiction — regardless of European privacy laws.

This has already led to remarkable situations. In one case, the United States allegedly pressured Microsoft to restrict access for the **International Criminal Court** when it investigated potential war crimes by U.S. personnel — an example of how geopolitical leverage can extend deep into digital infrastructure.
