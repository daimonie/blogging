 
# Should our government become a hyperscaler?

The cloud has become as essential as roads and water. Why is it owned by commercial foreign actors? An invisible layer of cloud infrastructure underpins modern life. 

## How the cloud underpins everything
Do you use the cloud? You probably do — even if you don’t realize it.

For most people not working in IT, *the cloud* is almost mythical. The cloud is the solution for everything and nothing. Depending on who you ask, it will be brought up as a solution to all your problems. This is important: *the cloud is the foundational layer* of modern society. Public services, government institutions, banks and public transport rely on cloud platforms, but also everyday technologies: your phone, laptop, website, apps, smart home devices—all constantly interacting with the cloud.

In essence, the cloud means renting someone else’s data center. Instead of each organization maintaining its own servers, companies now rent computing power from global platforms. Over time, this evolved further; you can now rent not just raw computing resources, but also the *software* and *infrastructure* that run on them. That simple shift — from ownership to dependency — changed everything.
 
This dependence has recently intensified with the rise of *Generative AI* — systems like ChatGPT, Grok, and Mistral all require enormous data centers to function. And it’s not just people using these tools anymore: much of the software we depend on is now quietly powered by Generative AI as well. Automation, personalization, and even decision-making are increasingly driven by AI models that live — and learn — in the cloud.

Modern life depends on cloud infrastructure—a dependency that has intensified with Generative AI. 

## Why Dependence on Foreign Platforms Matters

And we don’t control that cloud. Almost all of the infrastructure we rely on — including systems used by our government, semi-public institutions, and major corporations — runs on American cloud giants: **American hyperscalers**. These companies are vast, benefit from enormous economies of scale, and integrate open source innovations into cohesive, high-performance platforms. The European cloud market is dominated by US companies: nearly 70% of cloud infrastructure is controlled by three US hyperscalers, and a vast majority (90+%) of European data is still hosted by US-based providers ([European Parliament, 2025](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-10-2025-0107_EN.html#_section2)).

They are, in many ways, marvels of engineering — but they are not *ours.* They answer to shareholders, not to citizens. Their priorities are commercial, not public. When critical digital infrastructure depends entirely on foreign entities, we lose not just technical control, but also democratic oversight.

This dependence carries legal and political risks as well. The **U.S. CLOUD Act** (Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act) gives American authorities the right to demand access to data held by U.S.-based companies, even when that data is stored abroad. In practice, this means that information hosted on American cloud platforms may fall under U.S. jurisdiction — regardless of European privacy laws (such as GDPR).

This has already led to remarkable situations. In one case, the United States allegedly pressured Microsoft to restrict access for the **International Criminal Court** — an example of how geopolitical leverage can extend deep into digital infrastructure. Such incidents remind us that control over data is not merely technical, but political ([Politico, 2025](https://www.politico.eu/article/microsoft-did-not-cut-services-international-criminal-court-president-american-sanctions-trump-tech-icc-amazon-google/), [AP News, 2025](https://apnews.com/article/icc-trump-sanctions-karim-khan-court-a4b4c02751ab84c09718b1b95cbd5db3)).

If control over the cloud has become a question of power, then perhaps we should treat it like we treat other critical infrastructure: as a public good. This loss of control has both political and economic consequences—the latter of which reveals a deeper structural dependency.

# Economic Cost: The EU is Set to Be a User, Not a Producer  
## Lack of Infrastructure  

The EU's consumes AI technology at scale, but produces little of the infrastructure that enables it. This causes capital to flee the EU. This infrastructure gap creates a structural dependency where Europe has strong AI adoption and research, but lags in developing foundational infrastructure.  We pay, in part, for the infrastructure; and the home country takes that to build more infrastructure, making us ever more dependent.

The Netherlands is home to ASML, the world’s leading supplier to the semiconductor industry, yet Europe does not produce a relevant amount of the chips it needs. Even companies like Nexperia, whose ownership and intellectual property are protected as strategic assets by the Dutch government ([NOS, 2025](https://nos.nl/artikel/2586270-kabinet-grijpt-hard-in-bij-chipfabrikant-nexperia)), do not change the fact that large-scale semiconductor production remains external to the EU. This lack of domestic capacity extends to cloud infrastructure—so much so that Nvidia, the single largest producer of chips for AI workloads, omitted EU revenues from its 2024 financial report ([Nvidia, 2024](https://investor.nvidia.com/financial-info/financial-reports/)).  

In 2023, the EU held just **12.7% of the global semiconductor market**. The [EU Chips Act](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-chips-industry/) aims to double this share by 2030 to strengthen Europe’s technology ecosystem and reduce reliance on external suppliers. Yet, even with **53% of global AI leadership** (mainly in B2B applications), the EU controls only a fraction of global semiconductor fabrication capacity—the hardware backbone of AI compute.  

This mismatch means much of the economic value generated by AI ultimately leaves the continent, via either the infrastructure it pays for or the software it runs on—representing capital flight and lost reinvestment capacity ([DigitalEurope Critical Tech Gap Report, 2024](https://cdn.digitaleurope.org/uploads/2024/06/DIGITALEUROPE-EU-CRITICAL-TECH-GAP-REPORT_WEB_UPDATED.pdf); [Frontier Economic Security Report, 2024](https://cdn.digitaleurope.org/uploads/2024/06/REPORT-Economic-Security-Strategy-analysis-study-FINAL-STC.pdf)). Almost half of companies spend between 6-10% of their revenue on cloud cost ([CloudZero Cost benchmark](https://www.cloudzero.com/cloud-cost-benchmarking-tool/)), a cost split between infrastructure and software costs. This is only projected to get higher, with additional AI cost estimated at 5% of revenue for larger companies ([Computer Weekly](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366618023/Larger-businesses-spend-spend-spend-on-AI)).



## From Regulation to Action  

Europe's regulatory approach has long centered on *what* technology may do, not *where* it runs. But without infrastructure, rules alone can't ensure autonomy. To turn compliance into competitiveness, the EU must invest in the physical and digital backbone that allows those rules to function. This is where Public–Private Partnerships (PPPs) become more than funding tools—they are the bridge between policy and practice, aligning public accountability with private capacity. The proposed European Sovereign Cloud Authority could co-govern federated infrastructure under EU digital-sovereignty principles, similar to how EuroHPC manages high-performance computing.


## Regulatory Hurdles  

New regulatory frameworks increasingly compel EU-based companies to localize their technology stacks. The **AI Act**, **AI Liability Directive**, **Digital Fairness Act**, and **Digital Networks Act** all introduce new compliance layers for organizations relying on international infrastructure.  

While these regulations aim to foster data sovereignty and trust, they also create additional costs and operational burdens that U.S. and Chinese competitors do not face. From both an **economic** and **fairness** standpoint, if EU companies are required to comply with these localizations, the EU must provide the corresponding infrastructure to make compliance feasible and competitive.

## Public–Private Partnerships  

Large-scale infrastructure development is both possible and necessary on an EU-wide scale. Data centers and compute resources directly improve Europe's capacity to develop and scale critical technologies. **Public–Private Partnerships (PPPs)** are essential for this, enabling collaboration between industry and government while spreading financial risk.  

In the Netherlands, an opinion piece by **Geert-Jan Houben** for *de Volkskrant* showed that localized AI infrastructure can shield academia and startups from economic uncertainty and dependence on foreign providers. The study proposed that an investment of **€400 million**—well above the current **€45 million** budget—would fund a national AI platform accessible to research, startups, and universities, reducing the long-term cost burden on the public sector ([de Volkskrant, 2025](https://www.volkskrant.nl/columns-opinie/opinie-we-moeten-nu-investeren-in-een-nationale-ai-infrastructuur~bbd984742b/)).  

By contrast, the **U.S. Stargate Project** pledges **US$500 billion** for AI infrastructure, building 20 datacenters through a PPP involving OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle—with no direct public funding ([Washington Post, 2025](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/21/stargate-500-billion-trump-ai/)). The EU’s response, the **AI Factories Initiative**, aims to construct AI-specialized datacenters under the **EuroHPC** framework with a **€1.5 billion** budget for 2025, seeking **€200 billion** in total investments over seven years ([European Commission, 2024](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_6302)).  

The **EU Chips Act** already demonstrates PPP potential: of its **€100 billion** total, only **€3.3 billion** comes from EU-level funds, with the remainder contributed by member states—an effort intended to double Europe’s chip production share to **20% by 2030**.  

Finally, national governments are increasingly integrating AI into public infrastructure. In the Netherlands, agencies now use Generative AI for administrative tasks such as permit approvals and citizen inquiries. However, with limited domestic infrastructure, many rely on international suppliers like OpenAI, often deployed via Microsoft Azure—the platform that also underpins most Dutch government cloud services ([Rijksoverheid, 2025](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2025/04/22/overheid-verruimt-standpunt-inzet-generatieve-ai)).


# The Alternative: Public vs. Private Infrastructure
If control over the cloud has become a question of power—requiring democratic safeguards that commercial platforms cannot provide—then cloud infrastructure must be treated as a public good, not merely a product.

## What is a public good, a common good, a public service?
To ground the discussion, let's start with some loose economic definitions:
- A public good is something that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous, typically provided by the government and paid for through taxation. 
- A common good, by contrast, is rivalrous—such as fishing in a pond. There's a limited supply and a single person can deplete the resource.

Many public goods—such as railways, electricity grids, and telecom infrastructure—have been partially or fully privatized over the past few decades, with the assumption that market competition would lead to better or cheaper service. In practice, these services are treated as essential and universal. Internet access, for example, is now considered a basic need even though it is delivered by private companies.

I argue that cloud infrastructure—particularly as used in public services, education, and AI—has reached that threshold. Nearly every citizen interacts with cloud infrastructure, often unconsciously. Mobile apps, online banking, travel cards, healthcare portals and even government websites all run on cloud platforms. This makes the cloud functionally non-excludable—everyone should have access. (The full case for treating cloud as critical national infrastructure is developed in the section on digital sovereignty below.)

But for infrastructure this important, we normally expect democratic safeguards. Today's cloud is fully operated by commercial actors with global reach and zero obligation to the citizens. The risk is not just access restriction or censorship, but subtle forms of platform power—like slower performance for competitors, preferential treatment for corporate partners or quiet deprecation of critical services.

We wouldn't accept this from our road network or our national archives. We shouldn't accept it for the digital infrastructure that underpins them all.

## Is the cloud a public good?

If something becomes essential to daily life, should it remain a product?

If we're pragmatic, the private cloud market currently works. But it doesn't work in the interest of citizens, public agencies, or long-term resilience. 

The Netherlands — and the EU more broadly — has no control over the commercial conditions of the major cloud providers. If, tomorrow, the U.S. were to introduce a tariff or export restriction that doubled the cost of cloud services to European governments, we would have no recourse. This isn't alarmist—it's what dependency looks like.

We are now in a phase of digital infrastructure where control over data, AI models, and analytic workflows is no longer just a technical concern, but a matter of democratic oversight. These systems shape policy, automate public service delivery, and influence how decisions are made. The largest American cloud companies have market valuations that exceed the Dutch government's entire annual budget—a scale mismatch that limits regulatory leverage. As argued in the section on regulation below, we can't compel compliance through regulation alone.

This concern is especially pressing with the rise of Generative AI. The Dutch Ministry of the Interior (BZK) recently released a national position that encourages experimentation with Generative AI in the public sector—but only with strong guarantees around public values, privacy and responsibility ([government.nl](https://www.government.nl/documents/parliamentary-documents/2024/01/17/government-wide-vision-on-generative-ai-of-the-netherlands)). These guarantees mostly rely on legal contracts with commercial providers. A sovereign cloud platform would provide the technical foundation to enforce those guarantees, not just write them down.

Public infrastructure also matters for innovation. Startups and SMEs often can't afford enterprise-grade cloud services, particularly at scale. A Dutch public cloud could offer discounted or subsidized access in exchange for equity or royalties—similar to a startup loan model. If a startup succeeds, part of the upside flows back into the cloud platform, enabling further investment in infrastructure and innovation.

A comparable model already exists in Dutch academia: when a university researcher patents something, the rights are split three ways—between the inventor, the university, and the university fund. One portion rewards the creator, another covers legal and operational costs, and the final share supports future innovation.

A public cloud could adopt a similar framework, reinvesting Public–Private success into shared digital infrastructure. For the sake of discussion, let's limit ourselves to the simplest financial instrument: stocks. When the start-up inevitably sells or enters the stock exchange, the public cloud reclaims its ownership shares, selling automatically so that money flows back into the enabling infrastructure.

Sovereignty, fairness, and innovation aren’t competing ideals — they are interdependent. Each guards a different dimension of resilience. Together, they form the rationale for treating the cloud as a public utility.

# From Dependence to Sovereignty
## Digital infrastructure as a matter of national resilience

The cloud is now *critical national infrastructure*. It's as vital as energy, water, or electricity. Relying on foreign platforms means exposure to policy shifts, pricing changes, sanctions or data access laws—as detailed earlier with the CLOUD Act and commercial dependency. Control, continuity and choice — those are the watchwords for digital sovereignty.

The Dutch built flood defenses and energy grids for autonomy, for reliability, and for making sure everyone has access to critical infrastructure. The same is now true for cloud. Local control is required to reduce vulnerability to crises — cyberattacks, geopolitical tensions, or infrastructure failures. Sovereign infrastructure underpins not just security, but trust. Citizens must know where their data lives — who controls it. The logic of the platform must be *open*, so that we can have our checks and balances. Scale from government and semi-public institutions will increase robustness across the entire system, something that the technology sector can then benefit from.

Critics might argue that a public cloud would lag behind hyperscalers in innovation and cost efficiency. That's true — at first. But public value isn't measured quarterly, and sovereignty compounds. By embracing open source software, innovation is kept at a level similar to what hyperscalers already do — embrace open source initiatives, integrate them into a cohesive whole, and market it as an innovation.

Sovereignty requires openness. Paradoxically, the most independent infrastructure will be built from global collaboration and open-source software — the very antithesis of national isolation. A sovereign cloud isn't about isolation — it's about accountability. Just as our dikes protect the land, an open, public cloud protects our data.

## Why regulation alone is not enough
Our current European data protection (GDPR, Data Act, AI Act) focuses on rules for use, but not ownership of the infrastructure. European regulations are typically implemented through national laws — for example, the GDPR translated into the Dutch AVG — which do not address questions of infrastructure ownership.

Legal safeguards can't enforce technical autonomy, because the data is still hosted on US servers. This autonomy is further undermined by the regulatory risks outlined earlier—the CLOUD Act and its geopolitical implications, as demonstrated by the International Criminal Court case. Regulation is reactive and slow; infrastructure should be proactive and strategic. You can't regulate your way into owning the electricity grid, you must build it.

Public infrastructure enables *governance by design* — not as an afterthought once regulation finally catches up with innovation. We need this technical layer of sovereignty, not just a legal declaration.

Sovereignty isn't achieved through paperwork — it's built, maintained, and shared. And we already have the tools to do it — open-source platforms, PPP frameworks, and the EuroHPC governance model—which I will detail in a follow-up post.

# Reclaiming the Digital Commons
## Why this is not anti-market, but pro-democracy
Public clouds shouldn’t replace private ones — they should exist alongside them, giving citizens and governments a real choice. The goal isn't to dismantle hyperscalers, but to offer a transparent and accountable alternative. Public infrastructure benefits from healthy competition. If hyperscalers can do something better and cheaper, businesses should have that choice.

Democratically owned infrastructure protects long-term interests that markets, driven by quarterly incentives, often overlook. For hyperscalers, privacy too often feels like a hurdle rather than a principle. A public cloud would guarantee access to cloud infrastructure for our government and for our citizens. We want that access to be equal — no opaque deals between companies, but a clear and open structure.

Much like public libraries or public transport, this empowers the private sector by lowering cost and complexity of scaling new ideas. Through the innovation model outlined earlier—discounted access for startups and SMEs with success-based returns—public infrastructure enables the government to share modestly in the success it helps create, unlike today, where companies receive subsidies and later sell their innovations on the open market. The current internet age and technology sector benefited hugely from government subsidies and military contracts, but all our governments are trying to reduce their spending.

But no country can achieve true digital sovereignty alone — our future cloud must be built on European collaboration. Reclaiming part of that public stake isn’t anti-market — it’s about ensuring that the next wave of innovation strengthens Europe’s digital foundations, not erodes them

## A call for European leadership

Europe should lead the conversation on its own autonomous cloud infrastructure. The Netherlands can play a leading role - we are already home to open source excellence. We're not alone, though - France hosts the only European LLM while Germany is strong on actual cloud providers that compete with American hyperscalers ([Xomnia, 2025](https://xomnia.com/post/navigating-the-european-cloud-landscape-open-telekom-cloud-stackit-and-ovhcloud-in-focus/?utm_content=405874903&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-2919540)).

Even the European Court of Auditors has called for coordinated, EU-wide investment in shared AI infrastructure ([ECA, Special Report 08/2024](https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/publications?ref=SR-2024-08)). A March 2025 joint declaration by the D9+ countries similarly urged the creation of shared digital infrastructure to support European startups ([S9+ Declaration](https://s9plus.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/S9-DECLARATION.pdf)). "Without sovereign infrastructure, Europe experiences a steady value drain—public funds fuel private innovation abroad."


This is a part of the *European digital sovereignty* — the effort to gain greater control and autonomy by reducing reliance on non-EU companies. 

We are at a critical time in the evolution of data-related technology. We already handed control of a large part of our personal data, but also our internet profile, to advertisers. We gave them the opportunity to build and control our everyday technology. Currently, we're looking at the rise of Generative AI and text-based automation. If the time for the EU to lead on their own future isn't now—when?

The Dutch have just voted for their new government. As the government forms, the moment has come to make digital sovereignty part of our national infrastructure strategy. And as a small, modern nation — we are ahead on many technologies —  we can lead and export our expertise to the EU.

EU and NL leadership must rest on a shared-ownership model — where public institutions and private innovators co-develop the foundations of digital sovereignty. A European public cloud should not only guarantee open, accountable access but also reinvest in the ecosystem it enables: government funding that earns its return through innovation, and innovation that strengthens the public infrastructure it relies on. The Netherlands can play a leading role in shaping this reciprocal model — building on its open-source strengths and tradition of cooperative enterprise.


Europe’s next research program should fund a federated public cloud prototype — governed under EU digital-sovereignty principles, co-managed by member states, and open-sourced by default. Just as we built dikes to protect our land from water. We can build clouds to protect our data — and our democracy — from dependence.
